This is a project that helps you get more github stars automatically,which is written in python 2.7.10.

There are two files,*github.py* and *github_join.py*.

- github_join.py can help you create thousands of github accounts.

- github.py can help you star your own repositories with the account you created with github_join.py.

- acc3.txt is a file of accounts created by me.You can use it directly.



Thanks for using.
